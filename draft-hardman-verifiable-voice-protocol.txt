                       Verifiable Voice Protocol
             draft-hardman-verifiable-voice-protocol-latest

Abstract

   Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes parties
   who are accountable for telephone calls, eliminating trust gaps that
   scammers exploit.  It adds value in the same problem domain as STIR
   [RFC8224] [RFC8225] [RFC8588], SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074], RCD [RCD-DRAFT]
   [RCD-PASSPORT], BCID [CTIA-BCID], and related technologies, although
   it is also usable with individual callers.  Like these other
   approaches, VVP binds strong cryptographic evidence to headers in the
   SIP [RFC3261] INVITE that initiates a phone call.  It also allows
   this evidence to be verified downstream.  However, VVP builds from
   different technical and governance assumptions, with different
   backing evidence.  This unique foundation allows VVP to cross
   jurisdictional boundaries easily and robustly.  It also makes VVP
   simpler, more decentralized, cheaper to deploy and maintain, more
   private, more scalable, and higher assurance than alternatives.  VVP
   can plug gaps or build bridges between other approaches.  For
   example, it can justify an A attestation in SHAKEN when a call
   originates outside the regulated certificate ecosystem.  VVP can also
   be used as a standalone mechanism to identify and authorize callers.

1.  Introduction

   When we get phone calls, we want to know who's calling, and why.  If
   we could answer such questions with confidence, we would make
   reasonable judgments about whether to answer, based on the
   relationship and reputation context.

   Unfortunately, providing quality answers is much harder than it
   seems.  Scammers love to impersonate, and they succeed more often
   than we'd like.

   Regulators are mandating increased transparency to address this risk.
   This is wise, and it can be effective.  However, it introduces some
   heavy burdens.  Reliably vetting the identity of every possible
   caller is an ambitious task.  Maintaining a comprehensive, up-to-date
   graph of certificates and cryptographic keys to attest vetted
   identities is harder.  Operating a central registry of such
   identities and evidence, especially as phone calls increasingly cross
   jurisdictional boundaries, is harder still.  Regulatory constraints
   on data movement, shifting technical standards, variety in PSTNs and
   system interconnects, and many other factors further complexify.

   Yet the inherent limit in today's transparency efforts is even more
   fundamental: a pernicious gap between the party accountable for a
   phone call, and the party that provides evidence about who's calling.
   A decade ago, terminating service providers (TSPs) told us who's
   calling in a probabilistic way, based on unreliable metadata about a
   call's source.  More recently, approaches like STIR/SHAKEN move the
   evidence source closer to the origin, and add tamper protections.
   However, the gap persists.  The signer of a SHAKEN passport is the
   originating service provider (OSP), not the enterprise that makes a
   call, and we have no evidence to close this gap, other than the OSP's
   say-so.  Further, signers outside the regulated jurisdiction lack
   reputation for a mixture of reasons.  Thus, a high percentage of
   STIR/SHAKEN traffic does not receive an A attestation, and even the
   traffic that does receive it may receive it on imperfect evidence.

   In theory, the remaining gap could be eliminated by requiring a
   perfect authentication and authorization between callers and OSPs,
   for every phone call -- simply refuse to connect calls that do not
   match an ideal profile for trust.  However, this is impractical for
   many legitimate business reasons.  To cite one obvious example,
   Organization X might hire Call Center Y to call on their behalf,
   using X's reputation/brand and X's phone number.  In such a
   situation, X is the relevant answer to the "who's calling" question,
   but Y is the originator of the call -- and there's no good way to
   guarantee that everyone knows the existence and status of that
   relationship.  In addition, the market manifests a demand for
   wholesalers/aggregators of phone numbers, and is characterized by
   complex system layers and interconnects, that further challenge
   transparency.

   VVP solves these problems by applying two crucial innovations.

1.1.  Evidence format

   VVP uses an evidence format called _authentic chained data
   container_s (_ACDC_s) -- [TOIP-ACDC].  The chaining feature in ACDCs
   is safer, more powerful, and easier to maintain than the one in X509
   certificates [RFC5280].  It is also capable of modeling nuanced
   delegated relationships such as the one between Organization X and
   Call Center Y.  This eliminates the gap between accountable party and
   caller, while preserving perfect transparency.  Given X's formal
   approval, Y can sign a call on behalf of X, using a number allocated
   to X, and using X's brand, without impersonating X, and they can
   prove to any OSP or any other party, in any jurisdiction, that they
   have the right to do so.

   The evidence that Y cites can be built and maintained by X and Y,
   doesn't get stale or require periodic reissuance, and does not need
   to be published in a central registry.

   Further, when such evidence is filtered through suballocations or
   crosses jurisdictional boundaries, it can be reused, or linked and
   transformed, without altering its robustness or efficiency.  ACDCs
   verify data back to a root through arbitrarily long and complex
   chains of issuers, whereas formats like W3C Verifiable Credentials
   [W3C-VC] and SD-JWTs [SD-JWT-DRAFT] require direct trust in the
   proximate issuer.

   The synergies of these properties mean that ACDCs can be permanent,
   low-maintenance, lossless rather than lossy in delegation, and
   flexible rather than fragile.  When used as VVP requires, no third
   party has to guess who's accountable for a call; the accountable
   party is transparently and provably accountable, period.
   (Notwithstanding this transparency, ACDCs support a form of
   pseudonymity and graduated disclosure that satisfies vital privacy
   and data processing constraints.  See 5.)

1.2.  Vetting refinements

   Although VVP can work inside governance frameworks such as SHAKEN
   [ATIS-1000074], it allows for a dramatic upgrade of at least one key
   ingredient: the foundational vetting mechanism.  The ACDC format used
   by VVP is also the format used by the Verifiable Legal Entity
   Identifier (vLEI) standardized in [ISO-17442-3]. vLEIs use a KYC
   approach established by the Regulatory Oversight Committee of the
   G20, based on the LEI [ISO-17442-1] that's globally required in high-
   security, high-regulation, cross-border banking.

   To be clear, VVP does not _require_ that vLEIs be used for vetting.
   However, by choosing an evidence format that is high-precision and
   lossless enough to accommodate vLEIs, VVP lets telecom ecosystems opt
   in to trust bases that are already adopted, and that are not limited
   to any particular jurisdiction or to the telecom industry.  It thus
   offers two-way, easy bridges between identity in phone calls and
   identity in financial, legal, technical, logistic, regulatory, web,
   email, and social media contexts.  If VVP chose a weaker evidence
   format like X509 or SD-JWT or W3C VCs, higher vetting standards in
   some jurisdictions or use cases would not be an option.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview

   Fundamentally, Verifiable Voice Protocol requires a caller to
   assemble a Dossier of evidence that proves identity and
   authorization.  This is done once, in advance, as a configuration
   precondition.  Then, for each call, a STIR-compatible VVP PASSporT is
   built that cites this dossier.  Verifiers examine the dossier to make
   decisions.  PASSporTs are ephemeral and last only as long as an SIP
   INVITE is being evaluated, but the dossiers that they cite may be
   permanent and are cacheable.  Revocation of dossier details is
   checked in realtime.

3.1.  Roles

   Carefully defining the roles played by parties that participate in
   VVP is foundational to the rest of the specification.  The following
   terms have special meaning to VVP and may not match casual usage.

3.1.1.  Allocation Holder, TNU

   An _allocation holder_ (_AH_) is a party that controls how a
   telephone number is used, in the eyes of a regulator.  Typically,
   range holders are AHs, and so are the direct _telephone number users_
   (_TNUs_).  TNUs are customers of range holders -- enterprises and
   consumers.  Range holders are service providers; although they are
   AHs, they may not be TNUs for all the phone numbers in their
   allocated ranges.

   It is possible for an ecosystem to include other parties as AHs
   (e.g., wholesalers, aggregators).  However, some regulators dislike
   this outcome, and prefer that such parties broker allocations without
   actually holding the allocations as intermediaries.

3.1.2.  Terminating Party, Terminating Service Provider

   For a given phone call, the _terminating party_ (_TP_) is the party
   that receives the call.  These can be individual consumers or
   organizations.  The direct service provider of the TP is the
   _terminating service provider_ (_TSP_).

3.1.3.  Originating Party, Originating Service Provider

   An _originating party_ (_OP_) is a party that controls the first
   _session border controller_ (_SBC_) that processes a call.  It may be
   tempting to equate the OP with "the caller", but this equivalence
   lacks nuance and doesn't always hold.  In a VVP context, it is more
   accurate to say that the OP creates a SIP INVITE with explicit,
   provable authorization from the party accountable for calls on the
   originating phone number.

   The direct service provider of an OP is its _originating service
   provider_ (_OSP_).  For a given phone call, there may be many layers,
   boundaries, and transitions between OSP and TSP.

3.1.4.  Accountable Party

   An _accountable party_ (_AP_) is a TNU -- an organization or
   individual that holds the right to use a telephone number (RTU) in
   the eyes of a regulator.  When a terminating party asks, "Who's
   calling?", it is almost always the AP that they want to identify;
   thus, the AP is "the caller", as far as the TP concerned.  APs MAY
   operate their own SBCs and therefore be OPs.  However, APs may also
   use a UCaaS provider that makes this relationship indirect for
   logistical reasons.  Going further, a business can hire a call
   center, and delegate to the call center the right to use its phone
   number.  In such a case, the business is the AP, but the call center
   is the OP that makes calls on its behalf.

3.1.5.  Verifier

   A _verifier_ is a party that wants to know who's calling, and why,
   and that evaluates the answers to these questions by examining formal
   evidence.  TPs, TSPs, OSPs, government regulators, law enforcement
   doing lawful intercept, auditors, and even APs or OPs can be
   verifiers.  Each may need to see different views of the evidence
   about a particular phone call, and it may be impossible to comply
   with various regulations unless these views are kept distinct -- yet
   each wants similar and compatible assurance.

   In addition to checking the validity of cryptographic evidence, the
   verifier role in VVP MAY also consider how that evidence matches
   business rules and external conditions.  For example, a verifier
   might begin its analysis by deciding whether Call Center Y has the
   right, in the abstract, to make calls on behalf of Organization X
   using a given telephone number.  However, VVP evidence allows a
   verifier to go further: it can also consider whether Y is allowed to
   exercise this right at the particular time of day when a call occurs,
   or in the jurisdiction of a particular TP, given the business purpose
   asserted in a particular call.

3.2.  Lifecycle note

   VVP depends on three interrelated activities with evidence:

   *  Curating

   *  Citing

   *  Verifying

   Chronologically, evidence must be curated before it can be cited or
   verified.  In addition, some trust gaps in existing approaches occur
   precisely because too few requirements are imposed on evidence.
   Therefore, understanding the nature of backing evidence, and how that
   evidence is created and maintained, is a crucial consideration for
   VVP.  This specification includes normative statements about
   evidence.

   However, curating does not occur in realtime during phone calls.
   Citing and verifying are the heart of VVP, and implementers will
   probably approach VVP from the standpoint of SIP flows.  Therefore,
   we defer the question of curation.  Where not-yet-explained evidence
   concepts are used, inline references allow easy cross-reference to
   formal definitions.

3.3.  Citing

   A call secured by VVP begins when the OP (3.1.3) builds a VVP
   PASSporT that complies with STIR [RFC8224].  The passport is a
   compact-serialized JWT [RFC7519] that appears in an Identity header
   in a SIP INVITE.  In its JSON-serialized form, a typical VVP PASSporT
   might look like this:

   {
     "header": {
       "alg": "EdDSA",
       "typ": "JWT",
       "ppt": "passport",
       "kid": "https://agentsrus.net/oobi/EMCYrQqWyRLAYqMLYv_qm-qP7eKN81Wmjyz5nXQvYLYa/agent/EAxBDJkpA0rEjUG8vJrMdZKw8YL63r_7zYUMDrZMf1Wx",
     }
     "payload": {
       "orig": {"tn": ["+17035550001"]},
       "dest": {"tn": ["+15715550000"]},
       "card": ["NICKNAME:Examples-R-Us", "CHATBOT:https://example.com/chatwithus",
         "LOGO;HASH=EK2r6EnDXre2pecTBO8s99j4OtNaaDIhVyr7uGugDhmp;VALUE=URI:https://example.com/logo64x48.png"],
       "call-reason": "schedule next appointment",
       "evd": "https://acme.com/dossier.cesr",
       "origId": "e0ac7b44-1fc3-4794-8edd-34b83c018fe9",
       "iat": 1699840000,
       "exp": 1699840030,
       "jti": "70664125-c88d-49d6-b66f-0510c20fc3a6"
     }
   }

   The semantics of the fields are:

   *  alg _(required)_ MUST be "EdDSA".  Standardizing on one scheme
      prevents jurisdictions with incompatible or weaker cryptography.
      The RSA, HMAC, and ES256 algorithms MUST NOT be used.  (This
      choice is motivated by compatibility with the vLEI and its
      associated ACDC ecosystem, which depends on the Montgomery-to-
      Edwards transformation.)

   *  typ _(required)_ MUST be "JWT".

   *  ppt _(required)_ Per STIR, MUST be "passport".

   *  kid _(required)_ MUST be the OOBI of an AID controlled by the OP.
      Typically this is NOT the AID that identifies the OP as a legal
      entity, but rather an AID controlled by software running on or
      invoked by the SBC operated by the OP.  (The AID that identifies
      the OP as a legal entity may be controlled by a multisig scheme
      and thus require multiple humans to create a signature.  This AID
      MUST be singlesig and, in the common case where it is not the
      legal entity AID, MUST have a delegate relationship with the legal
      entity AID, proved through Delegate Evidence.)

   *  orig _(required)_ MUST conform to SHAKEN requirements, with the
      additional constraint that only one phone number is allowed.
      Although the containing SIP INVITE may allow multiple originating
      phone numbers, only one can be tied to evidence evaluated by
      verifiers.

   *  dest _(required)_ MUST conform to SHAKEN requirements.

   *  evd _(required)_ MUST be the OOBI of a bespoke ACDC that
      constitutes a verifiable data graph of all evidence justifying
      belief in the identity and authorization of the AP, the OP, and
      any relevant delegations.  An OOBI is a special URL that returns
      IANA content-type application/json+cesr.  Such a URL can be hosted
      on any convenient web server, and is analogous to the x5u header
      in X509 contexts.  See below for details.

   *  origId _(optional)_ Follows SHAKEN semantics.

   *  iat _(required)_ Follows standard JWT semantics.

   *  jti _(required)_ Follows standard JWT semantics.

3.4.  Verifying

   (TODO: Verifier has a cache that was populated by monitoring the
   witnesses of known issuer AIDs.  (If a new issuer is encountered, it
   can look up the witnesses and begin monitoring.)  Etc.

   Also discuss deploying in a hybrid mode to extend S/S.)

3.5.  Evidence

3.5.1.  General categories

   The term "credential" has a fuzzy meaning in casual conversation.
   However, understanding how evidence is built from credentials in VVP
   requires considerably more precision.  We will start from lower-level
   concepts.

3.5.1.1.  SAID

   A _self-addressing identifier_ (_SAID_) is the hash of a
   canonicalized JSON object, encoded in self-describing CESR format
   [TOIP-CESR].  The raw bytes from the digest function are left-padded
   to the nearest 24-bit boundary, transformed to base64url [RFC4648],
   and prefixed with a character that tells which digest function was
   used.

   An example of a SAID is E81Wmjyz5nXMCYrQqWyRLAYeKNQvYLYqMLYv_qm-qP7a,
   and a regex that matches all valid SAIDs is:
   [EFGHI][-_\w]{43}|0[DEFG][-_\w]{86}. The E prefix in the example
   indicates that it is a Blake3-256 hash.

   SAIDs are evidence that hashed data has not changed.  They can also
   function like a reference, hyperlink, or placeholder for the data
   that was hashed to produce them (though they are more similar to URNs
   than to URLs [RFC3986], since they contain no location information).

3.5.1.2.  Signature

   A digital signature over arbitrary data D constitutes evidence that
   the signer processed D with a signing function that took D and the
   signer's private key as inputs: signature = sign(D, privkey).  The
   evidence can be verified by checking that the signature is bound to D
   and the public key of the signer: valid = verify(signature, D,
   pubkey).  Assuming that the signer has not lost unique control of the
   private key, and that cryptography is appropriately strong, we are
   justified in the belief that the signer must have taken deliberate
   action that required seeing an unmodified D in its entirety.

   The assumption that a signer has control over their private keys may
   often be true (or at least believed, by the signer) at the time a
   signature is created.  However, after key compromise, an attacker can
   create and sign evidence that purports to come from the current or an
   earlier time period, unless signatures are anchored to a data source
   that detects anachronisms.  Lack of attention to this detail
   undermines the security of many credential schemes, including in
   telecom.  VVP explicitly addresses this concern.

3.5.1.3.  AID

   An _autonomic identifier_ (_AID_) is a short string that can be
   resolved to one or more cryptographic keys at a specific version of
   their key state.  Using cryptographic keys, a party can prove it is
   the controller of an AID by creating digital signatures.  AIDs are
   like W3C DIDs [W3C-DID]}, and can be transformed into DIDs.  The
   information required to resolve an AID to its cryptographic keys is
   communicated through a special form of URI called an _out-of-band
   invitation_ (_OOBI_).  An OOBI points to an HTTP resource that
   returns IANA content-type application/json+cesr; it is somewhat
   analogous to a combination of the kid and x5u constructs in many
   JWTs.  AIDs and OOBIs are defined in the KERI spec [TOIP-KERI].

   An example of an AID is EMCYrQqWyRLAYqMLYv_qm-qP7eKN81Wmjyz5nXQvYLYa.
   AIDs are created by calculating the hash of the identifier's
   inception event data structure; they therefore match the same regex
   as SAIDs in general.  An example of an OOBI is
   https://agentsrus.net/oobi/EMCYrQqWyRLAYqMLYv_qm-
   qP7eKN81Wmjyz5nXQvYLYa/agent/
   EAxBDJkpA0rEjUG8vJrMdZKw8YL63r_7zYUMDrZMf1Wx.  Note the same EMCY...
   IN both strings.  Many constructs in KERI may have OOBIs, but when
   OOBIs are associated with AIDs, such OOBIs always contain their
   associated AID as the first URL segment that matches the AID regex.
   They point either to an agent or a witness that provides verifiable
   state information for the AID.

   AIDs possess several security properties that are not guaranteed by
   DIDs in general (self-certification, support for prerotation and
   multisig, support for witnesses, cooperative delegation, and so
   forth).  These properties are vital to some of VVP's goals for high
   assurance.

3.5.1.4.  Signatures over SAIDs

   Since neither a SAID value nor the data it hashes can be changed
   without breaking the correspondence between them, signing over a SAID
   is equivalent, in how it commits the signer to content and provides
   tamper evidence, to signing over the data that the SAID hashes.
   Since SAIDs can function as placeholders for JSON objects, a SAID can
   represent such an object in a larger data structure.  And since SAIDs
   can function as a reference without making a claim about location, it
   is possible to combine these properties to achieve some indirections
   in evidence that are crucial in privacy and regulatory compliance.

   VVP uses SAIDs and digital signatures as primitive forms of evidence.

3.5.1.5.  X509 certificates

   VVP does not depend on X509 certificates [RFC5280] for any of its
   evidence.  However, if deployed in a hybrid mode, it MAY be used
   beside alternative mechanisms that are certificate-based.  In such
   cases, self-signed certificates that never expire might suffice to
   tick certificate boxes, while drastically simplifying the burden of
   maintaining accurate, unexpired, unrevoked views of authorizations
   and reflecting that knowledge in certificates.  This is because deep
   authorization analysis flows through VVP's more rich and flexible
   evidence chain.

3.5.1.6.  PASSporT

   VVP emits and verifies a STIR PASSporT [RFC8225].  This is a form of
   evidence suitable for evaluation during the brief interval when a
   call is being initiated, and it is carefully backed by evidence with
   a longer lifespan (see Dossier).  Conceptually, VVP's version is
   similar to a SHAKEN passport [RFC8588].  It MAY also reference brand-
   related evidence, allowing it to play an additional role similar to
   the RCD passport [RCD-PASSPORT].

   Neither VVP's backing evidence nor its passport depends on a
   certificate authority ecosystem.  The passport MUST be secured by an
   EdDSA digital signature [RFC8032], [FIPS186-4], rather than the
   signature variants preferred by the other passport types.  Instead of
   including granular fields in the claims of its JWT, the VVP passport
   cites a rich data graph of evidence by referencing the SAID of that
   data graph.  This indirection and its implications are discussed
   below.

3.5.1.7.  ACDCs

   Besides digital signatures and SAIDs, and the ephemeral passport, VVP
   uses long-lasting evidence in the ACDC format [TOIP-ACDC].  This is
   normalized, serialized data with an associated digital signature.
   Unlike X509 certificates, ACDCs are bound directly to the AIDs of
   their issuers and issuees, not to public keys of these parties.  This
   has a radical effect on the lifecycle of evidence, because keys can
   be rotated without invalidating ACDCs.

3.5.1.8.  KELs {:#KEL}

   Unlike X509 certificates, JWTs [RFC7519], and W3C Verifiable
   Credentials [W3C-VC], signatures over ACDC data are not _contained
   inside_ the ACDC; rather, they are _referenced by_ the ACDC and
   _anchored in_ a verifiable data structure called a _key event log_ or
   _KEL_ [TOIP-KERI].

                      Figure 2: X509 compared to ACDC

   A KEL has some trust characteristics that resemble a blockchain.
   However, it is specific to one AID only (the AID of the issuer of the
   ACDC) and thus is not centralized.  The KELs for two different AIDs
   need not (and typically do not) share any common storage or
   governance, and do not require coordination or administration.  KELs
   thus suffer none of the performance and governance problems of
   blockchains, and incur none of blockchain's difficulties with
   regulatory requirements like data locality or right to be forgotten.

   ACDCs can be freely converted between text and binary
   representations, and either type of representation can also be
   compacted or expanded to support nuanced disclosure goals.  An ACDC
   is also uniquely identified by its SAID, which means that a SAID can
   take the place of a full ACDC in certain data structures and
   processes.  None of these transformations invalidate the associated
   digital signatures, which means that any variant of a given ACDC is
   equivalently verifiable.

   The revocation of a given ACDC can be detected via the witnesses
   declared in its issuer's KEL.  Discovering, detecting, and reacting
   to such events can be very efficient.  Any number of aggregated views
   can be built on demand, for any subset of an ecosystem's evidence, by
   any party.  This requires no special authority or access, and does
   not create a central registry as a source of truth, since such views
   are tamper-evident and therefore can be served by untrusted parties.
   Further, different views of the evidence can contain or elide
   different fields of the evidence data, to address privacy,
   regulatory, and legal requirements.

3.5.1.9.  CVD

   _Cryptographically verifiable data_ (_CVD_) is data that's associated
   with a digital signature and a claim about who signed it.  When CVD
   is an assertion, we make the additional assumption that the signer
   intends whatever the data asserts, since they took an affirmative
   action to create non-repudiable evidence that they processed it.  CVD
   can be embodied in many formats, but in the context of VVP, all
   instances of CVD are ACDCs.

3.5.1.10.  Credential

   A _credential_ is a special kind of CVD that asserts entitlements for
   its legitimate bearer -- _and only its bearer_. CVD that says
   Organization X exists with a particular ID number in government
   registers, and with a particular legal name, is not necessarily a
   credential.  In order to be a credential, it would have to be
   associated with an assertion that its legitimate bearer -- _and only
   its bearer_ -- is entitled to use the identity of Organization X.  If
   signed data merely enumerates properties without conferring
   privileges on a specific party, it is just CVD.  Many security gaps
   in existing solutions arise from conflating CVD and credentials.

   ACDCs can embody any kind of CVD, not just credentials.

3.5.1.11.  Bearer token

   VVP never uses bearer tokens, but we define them here to provide a
   contrast.  A _bearer token_ is a credential that satisfies binding
   requirements by a trivial test of possession -- like a movie ticket,
   the first party that presents the artifact to a verifier gets the
   privilege.  Since Bearer Credentials can be stolen or copied, this is
   risky.  JWTs, session cookies, and other artifacts in familiar
   identity technologies are often bearer tokens, even if they carry
   digital signatures.  Although they can be protected to some degree by
   expiration dates and secure channels, these protections are
   imperfect.  For example, TLS channels can be terminated and recreated
   at multiple places between call origination and delivery.

3.5.1.12.  Targeted credential

   A _targeted credential_ is CVD that identifies an issuee as the
   bearer, and that requires the issuee to prove their identity
   cryptographically (e.g., to produce a proper digital signature) in
   order to claim the associated privilege.  All credentials in VVP are
   targeted credentials.

3.5.1.13.  JL

   A _justifying link_ (_JL_) is a reference, inside of one CVD, to
   another CVD that justifies what the first CVD is asserting.  JLs can
   be SAIDs that identify other ACDCs.

3.5.2.  Specific evidence

3.5.2.1.  PSS

   Each voice call begins with a SIP INVITE, and in VVP, each SIP INVITE
   contains an Identity header that MUST contain a signature from the
   call's OP.  This _passpport-specific signature_ (_PSS_) MUST be an
   Ed25519 signature serialized as CESR; it is NOT a JWS.  The 64 raw
   bytes of the signature are left-padded to 66 bytes, then base64url-
   encoded.  The AA at the front of the result is cut and replaced with
   0B, giving an 88-character string.  A regex that matches the result
   is: 0B[-_\w]{86}, and a sample value (with the middle elided) is:
   0BNzaC1lZD...yRLAYeKNQvYx.

   The signature MUST be the result of running the EdDSA algorithm over
   input data that consists of the following ordered metadata about a
   call: the source phone number (orig claim in the JWT), the
   destination phone number (dest claim), an OOBI for the OP (kid), a
   timestamp (iat), optional brand information (card with value null if
   missing), optional call-reason (with value null if missing), optional
   goal (with value null if missing), and a reference to evidence (evd).

3.5.2.2.  Dossier

   The evd field in the passport contains the OOBI of an ACDC data graph
   (CVD asserted to the world, not a Credential issued to a specific
   party) called the _dossier_. This is a compilation of all the
   permanent, backing evidence that justifies trust in the identity and
   authorization of the AP and OP.  It is created and must be signed by
   the AP.

3.5.2.3.  APE

   The dossier MUST include at least what is called _accountable party
   evidence_ (_APE_).

   APE consists of several credentials, explored in detail below.  It
   MUST include a vetting credential for the AP. it MUST include a
   TNAlloc credential that proves RTU.  Normally the RTU MUST be
   assigned to the AP; however, if a proxy is the OP and uses their own
   telephone number, the RTU MUST be assigned to the OP instead.  If the
   AP intends to contextualize the call with a brand, it MUST include a
   brand credential for the AP.  (In cases where callers are private
   individuals, "brand" maps to descriptive information about the
   individual, as imagined in mechanisms like VCard [RFC6350] or JCard
   [RFC7095].)  If no brand credential is present, verifiers MUST NOT
   impute a brand to the call on the basis of any VVP guarantees.

3.5.2.4.  Delegation Evidence (:#DE)

   When a private individual makes a call with VVP, they might be both
   the AP and the OP.  In such cases, we expect their AID to be the
   recipient or issuee of all the APE, and no backing evidence beyond
   the APE may be necessary.  However, in business contexts, it will
   almost always be true that the OP role is played by a delegate.  In
   such conditions, evidence must also include proof that this
   indirection is valid.  We call this _delegation evidence_ (_DE_).

   DE is nearly always required when the AP is an organization, because
   the cryptographic identifier for the organization as a legal entity
   is typically not the same as the cryptographic identifier for the
   organization's automated software that prepares SIP INVITEs.  DE can
   thus distinguish between Acme Corporation in general, and software
   operated by Acme's IT department for the express purpose of signing
   voice traffic.  The former has a vetting credential and legal
   accountability, and can act as the company to publish press releases,
   prepare invoices, spend money, and make attestations to regulators;
   the latter should only be able to sign outbound voice calls on Acme's
   behalf.  Failing to make this distinction creates serious
   cybersecurity risks.

      Figure 3: Sample evidence graph; OP kid could bind to APE or DE

   Where DE exists, the APE will identify and authorize the AP, but the
   OOBI in the kid claim of the passport will identify the OP, and these
   two parties will be different.  Therefore, the DE in the dossier MUST
   include a delegated signer credential that authorizes the OP to act
   on the AP's behalf and that stipulates the constraints that govern
   this delegation.  It SHOULD also include a vetting credential for the
   OP, that proves the OP's identity.  If the APE includes a brand
   credential, then the DE MUST also include a brand proxy credential,
   proving that the OP not only can use the AP's allocated telephone
   number, but has AP's permission to project the AP's brand while doing
   so.

   The PASSporT-specific signature MUST come from the OP, not the OSP or
   any other party.  The OP can generate this signature in its on-prem
   or cloud PBX, using keys that it controls.  It is crucial that the
   distinction between OP and AP be transparent, with the relationship
   proved by strong evidence that the AP can create or revoke easily, in
   a self-service manner.

3.5.2.5.  Vetting credential

   A vetting credential is a targeted credential that enumerates the
   formal and legal attributes of a unique legal entity.  It MUST
   include a legal identifier that makes the entity unique in its home
   jurisdiction (e.g., an LEI), and it MUST include an AID for the legal
   entity as an AP.  This AID is unique globally.  The vetting
   credential is so called because it MUST be issued according to a
   documented vetting process that offers formal assurance that is is
   only issued with accurate information, and only to the entity it
   describes.  A vetting credential confers the privilege of acting with
   the associated legal identity if and only if the bearer can prove
   their identity as issuee via a digital signature from the issuee's
   AID.

   A vetting credential MUST include a JL to a credential that qualifies
   the issuer as a party trusted to do vetting.  This linked credential
   that qualifies the issuer of the vetting credential MAY contain a JL
   that qualifies its own issuer, and such JLs MAY be repeated through
   as many layers as desired.  In VVP, the reference type of a vetting
   credential is an LE vLEI.  This implies both a schema and a
   governance framework.  Other vetting credential types are possible,
   but they MUST be true credentials that meet the normative
   requirements here.  They MUST NOT be bearer tokens.

   (TODO: sample vetting credential)

3.5.2.6.  TNAlloc credential

   A TNAlloc credential is a targeted credential that confers on its
   issuee the right to control how one or more telephone numbers are
   used.  Regulators issue TNAlloc credentials to range holders, who
   issue them to TNUs.  TNUs often play the AP role in VVP.  If an AP
   delegates RTU to a proxy (e.g., an employee or call center), the AP
   MUST also issue a TNAlloc credential to the proxy, to confer the RTU.
   With each successive reallocation, the set of numbers in the new
   TNAlloc credential gets smaller.  Except for TNAlloc credentials
   issued by regulators, all TNAlloc credentials MUST contain a JL to a
   parent TNAlloc credential, having a bigger set of numbers that
   includes those in the current credential.  This JL in a child
   credential documents the fact that the child's issuer possessed an
   equal or broader RTU, from which the subset RTU in child credential
   derives.

3.5.2.7.  Brand credential

   A brand credential is a targeted credential that enumerates brand
   properties such as a brand name, logo, chatbot URL, social media
   handle, and domain name.  It MUST be issued to an AP as a legal
   entity, but it does not enumerate the formal and legal attributes of
   the AP; rather, it enumerates properties that would be meaningful to
   a TP who's deciding whether to take a phone call.  It confers on its
   issuee the right to use the described brand by virtue of research
   conducted by the issuer (e.g., a trademark search).

   (TODO: sample brand credential)

   This credential MUST be issued according to a documented process that
   offers formal assurance that it is only issued with accurate
   information, and only to a legal entity that has the right to use the
   described brand.  A single AP MAY have multiple brand credentials
   (e.g., a fictional corporation, Amce Space Travel Deutschland, GmbH,
   might hold brand credentials for both Sky Ride and for Orbítame
   Latinoamérica).  Rights to use the same brand MAY be conferred on
   multiple APs (Acme Space Travel Deutschland, Gmbh and Acme Holdings
   Canada, Ltd may both possess brand credentials for Sky Ride).  A
   brand credential MUST contain a JL to a vetting credential, that
   shows that the right to use the brand was evaluated only after using
   a vetting credential to prove the identity of the issuee.

3.5.2.8.  Brand proxy credential

   A brand proxy credential confers on an OP the right to project the
   brand of an AP when making phone calls, subject to a carefully
   selected set of constraints.  This is different from the simple RTU
   conferred by TNAlloc.  Without a brand proxy credential, a call
   center could make calls on behalf of an AP, using the AP's allocated
   phone number, but would be forced to do so under its own name or
   brand, because it lacks evidence that the AP intended anything
   different.  If an AP intends for phone calls to be made by a proxy,
   and wants the proxy to project the AP's brand, the AP MUST issue this
   credential.

3.6.  Curating

   The evidence that's available in today's telecom ecosystems resembles
   some of the evidence described above, in concept.  However, it has
   gaps, and its format is fragile.  Furthermore, if it is organized for
   discovery, it is typically assembled into large, centralized
   registries at a regional or national level.  These registries become
   a trusted third party, which defeats some of the purpose of creating
   decentralized and independently verifiable evidence in the first
   place.  Sharing such evidence across jurisdiction boundaries requires
   regulatory compatibility and bilateral agreements.  Sharing at scale
   is impractical at best, if not downright illegal.

   How evidence is issued, propagated, and reference is therefore an
   important concern for this specification.

3.6.1.  Vetting

   The job of vetting legal entities (which includes APs, but also OPs)
   and issuing vetting credentials is performed by a Legal Entity Vetter
   (LEV).  VVP places few requirements on such vetters, other than the
   ones already listed for vetting credentials themselves.  Vetting
   credentials do not need to expire, and in fact ACDCs and AIDs
   facilitate much longer lifecycles than certificates; prophylactic key
   rotation is recommended but creates no reason to rotate evidence.
   However, the LEV MUST agree to revoke vetting credentials in a timely
   manner if the legal status of an entity changes, or if data in a
   vetting credential becomes invalid.

3.6.2.  Brand information

   The job of analyzing the brand assets of a legal entity and issuing
   brand credentials is performed by a Brand Vetter (BV).  A BV MAY be
   an LEV, and MAY issue both types of credentials after a composite
   analysis.  However, the credentials themselves MUST NOT use a
   combined schema, the credentials MUST have independent lifecycles,
   and the assurances associated with each credential type MUST remain
   independent.  A BV MUST verify the canonical properties of a brand,
   but it MUST do more than this: it MUST issue the brand credential to
   the AID of an issuee that is also the issuee of a vetting credential
   that already exists, and it MUST verify that the legal entity in the
   vetting credential has a right to use the brand in question.  This
   link MUST NOT be based on mere weak evidence such as an observation
   that the legal entity's name and the brand name have some or all
   words in common, or the fact that a single person requested both
   credentials.  Further, the BV MUST agree to revoke brand credentials
   in a timely manner if the associated vetting credential is revoked,
   if the legal entity's right to use the brand changes, or if
   characteristics of the brand evolve.

3.6.3.  TN allocations

   Regulators issue TNAlloc credentials to range holders, and range
   holders issue them to TNUs, and TNUs MAY issue them to a delegate.
   If aggregators or other intemediaries hold an RTU in the eyes of a
   regulator, then intermediate TNAlloc credentials MUST be created to
   track that RTU as part of the chain.  On the other hand, if TNUs
   acquire telephone numbers through aggregators, but regulators do not
   consider aggregators to hold allocations, then aggregators MUST work
   with range holders to assure that the appropriate TNAlloc credentials
   are issued to the TNUs.

3.6.4.  Brand proxy

   APs issue brand proxy credentials to OPs.

   Vetting and brand credentials may require large databases of metadata
   about organizations and brands, but how such systems work is out of
   scope.  Once credentials are issued, they are an independent source
   of truth.  No party has to return to the operators of such databases
   to validate anything.

   Issuance and revocation of all other credentials is self-service at
   every level, and does not require any large, centralized system.
